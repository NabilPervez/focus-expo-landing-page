# FOCUS Expo Brand Bible

## COLOR BREAKDOWN
This palette is built around a calm, grounded foundation with intentional moments of emphasis. Coast, the primary accent, provides clarity and focus, while Tangerine and Terracotta introduce warmth and energy in a controlled, supportive way. Together, the accents create contrast without overwhelming the overall system.

The neutral base balances the palette. Ivory and its light shade keep layouts open and approachable, while Atlas and its darker shade replace pure black to add depth, structure, and visual stability. These neutrals allow content to lead, with color guiding attention rather than competing for it.

Overall, the palette feels steady, focused, and refined—supporting clear hierarchy, comfortable readability, and a composed visual presence across all applications.
